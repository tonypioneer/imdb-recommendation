# imdb-recommendation
This repository aims at providing a system for movie recommendation via collaborative filtering techniques and producing additional visualisations. The approach could be based on SVD or similar techniques such as nonnegative matrix factorisation (NMF). The performance of the proposed system should be evaluated using the IMDb datasets.
