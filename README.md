# IMDb Movie Recommendation System

This repository aims at providing a system for movie recommendation via
collaborative filtering techniques and producing additional visualisations.
The approach could be based on SVD or similar techniques such as nonnegative
matrix factorisation (NMF). The performance of the proposed system should be
evaluated using the IMDb datasets. It is a part of Project Research for the
COMP/ENGN8535 Engineering Data Analytics course of the Australian National
University.

## Project Idea

Implement a system for movie recommendation via collaborative filtering
techniques. The approach could be based on SVD or similar techniques such as
non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF). The performance of the proposed system
should be evaluated using the IMDb datasets.

- If you want to implement an SVD-based recommendation, please read "Netflix

- If you want to learn more about NMF, please read the following two papers:

After you complete the above movie recommendation task, you probably have gained
a better understanding that certain movies can often be clustered together. You
should then develop a data visualisation method to display a small subset (say
100 movies) of the 1700 movies on a 2-dimensional plane to visualise their
similarity or dissimilarity. You may randomly select 100 movies of different
genres, out of the 1700, for doing this experiment. To conduct this additional
experiment, one (or more) of the following techniques may be needed: PCA, or
MDS, or k-means. However, this is an open-ended task, there is no right or
wrong solution as long as you project the 100 movies on a 2D plane, and
convincingly visualise and explain their similarities.

## Project Task

Implement a movie recommendation system and to produce additional
visualisations using IMDB datasets, which can be found on Wattle.
